# TypeORM + Express spike

Just learning how to get MT to work with [TypeORM](https://typeorm.github.io/) and Express.

## tl;dr

JS support is so poor I couldn't even get a working integration. I read through code and the examples
they provide for JS support of entity definitions can't actually work. Basically this could be a cool library
if you are using TypeScript. Otherwise it's not feasible.

## Notes

+ MT Connection support is easy enough.
+ No createdAt, updatedAt support that I can find.
+ JS support (as far as documentation goes) is totally third-class. Barely any information how to do things NOT in JS.
